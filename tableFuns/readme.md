the non kableExtra version of the univariate frequencies function is here so that the jreyno projects can operate it on the hpc bc i havenet figured out how to get kableExtra working on the hpc. Once i figure that out, i will remove it and just use kable extra version. If i never get around to figuring it out and then remove the function later on and it results in a dependency break, there is also a copy of the non-kableExtra version in the R03 tools folder if you dont want to go through the commits.
